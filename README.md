Hi I'm ldiehm. I'm a computer engineering student at Purdue University. I am interested in software + embedded systems, and my favorite programming language is C!

The classes I'm taking right now are ECE 468 - Compilers, ECE 595 - Advanced Software Engineering, ECE 40862 - Software for Embedded Systems, and ECE 36900 - Discrete Math.

I'm in my last academic year at Purdue!

By the time you're reading this, I may be graduated. I probably won't update this doc too much.
